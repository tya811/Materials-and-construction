I don't have, or want to have any heavy machinery, so build blocks and harmonic balancers and cam shafts etcetera, so i can buy as many individual pistons as i can
magnetize every part of the engine, and then route some of the pistons to diesel, some to ethanol, and some to gas.

don't use screws, just use magnets and velcro and dowelling rods to build and finalize the engine that way it's super easy to build, take apart
and maintain. Needs tons of documents, examples, and tutorials. 

same with the whole car, make it so i can order parts, and they are clearly packaged and marked and come with magnets and velcro and labels to make the
build process a ton a ton a ton easier. 

induction brakes, magnetic steering, magnetic and electromagnetic hydraulics. 

and then document, label, and give examples of every engine component and what it can be used for and where it can be modded. for example
attatching a few small electric motors to the flywheel to get even smoother RPM and even more torque. 

Use tesla coils, not batteries. Tesla coils can power multiple devices at the same time wirelessly and can be run on a few solar cells.
